      use Net::Twitter;

      my $nt = Net::Twitter->new(
          traits   => [qw/API::REST/],
          username => $user,
          password => $password
      );

          for my $status ( @$statuses ) {
              print "$status->{created_at} <$status->{user}{screen_name}> $status->{text}\n";
          }
      };
      if ( my $err = $@ ) {
          die $@ unless blessed $err && $err->isa('Net::Twitter::Error');

          warn "HTTP Response Code: ", $err->code, "\n",
               "HTTP Message......: ", $err->message, "\n",
               "Twitter error.....: ", $err->error, "\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a perl interface to the Twitter APIs. See
    <http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-API-Documentation> for a full
    description of the Twitter APIs.

OMG! THE MOOSE!
    Net::Twitter is Moose based. Moose provides some advantages, including
    the ability for the maintainer of this module to respond quickly to
    Twitter API changes.

    See Net::Twitter::Lite if you need an alternative without Moose and its
    dependencies.

    Net::Twitter::Lite's API method definitions and documentation are
    generated from Net::Twitter. It is a related module, but does not depend
    on Net::Twitter or Moose for installation.

RETURN VALUES
    Net::Twitter decodes the data structures returned by the Twitter API
    into native perl data structures (HASH references and ARRAY references).
    The full layout of those data structures are not documented, here. They
    change often, usually with the addition of new elements, and documenting
    all of those changes would be a significant challenge.

    Instead, rely on the online Twitter API documentation and inspection of
    the returned data.

    The Twitter API online documentation is located at
    <http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-API-Documentation>.

    To inspect the data, use Data::Dumper or similar module of your choice.
    Here's a simple example using Data::Dumper:

        use Data::Dumper;

        my $r = $nt->search($search_term);
        print Dumper $r;

    For more information on perl data structures, see perlreftut, perldsc,
    and perllol.

METHODS AND ARGUMENTS
    new This constructs a "Net::Twitter" object. It takes several named
        parameters, all of them optional:

        traits
            An ARRAY ref of traits used to control which APIs the
            constructed "Net::Twitter" object will support and how it
            handles errors. Possible values are:

            API::REST
                Provides support for the Twitter REST API methods.

            API::Search
                Provides support for the Twitter Search API methods.

            API::TwitterVision
                Provides support for the TwitterVision API. See
                <http://twittervision.com/api.html>.

            WrapError
                "Net::Twitter" normally throws exceptions on error. When
                this trait is included, "Net::Twitter" returns undef when a
                method fails and makes the error available through method
                "get_error". This is the way all errors were handled in
                Net::Twitter versions prior to version 3.00.

            OAuth
                The "OAuth" trait provides OAuth authentication rather than
                the default Basic Authentication for Twitter API method
                calls. See the "Authentication" section and
                Net::Twitter::Role::OAuth for full documentation.

            InflateObjects
                When this optional trait is included, Net::Twitter inflates
                HASH refs returned by Twitter into objects with read
                accessors for each element. In addition, it inflates dates
                to DateTime objects and URLs to URI objects. Objects that
                include a "created_at" attribute also have a
                "relative_created_at" method.

                For example, with "InflateObjects" applied, the
                <friends_timeline> method returns an array of status
                objects:

                    $r = $nt->friends_timeline;
                    for my $status ( @$r ) {
                        $r->user->screen_name; # same as $r->{user}{screen_name}

                        # $created_at is a DateTime; $age is a DateTime::Duration
                        my $age = DateTime->now - $r->created_at;

                        # print an age in a similar style to the Twitter web site, e.g.:
                        # less than a minute ago
                        # about a minute ago
                        # 6 minutes ago
                        # 1 day ago
                        # etc.
                        print $r->relative_created_at;

            RateLimit
                The "RateLimit" trait adds utility methods that return
                information about the current rate limit status. See
                Net::Twitter::Role::RateLimit for details.

            Legacy
                This trait provides backwards compatibility to
                "Net::Twitter" versions prior to 3.00. It implies the traits
                "API::REST", "API::Search", "API::TwitterVision", and
                "API::WrapError". It also provides additional functionality
                to ensure consistent behavior for applications written for
                use with legacy versions of "Net::Twitter".

                In the current version, this trait is automatically included
                if the "traits" option is not specified. This ensures
                backwards compatibility for existing applications using
                "Net::Twitter" versions prior to 3.00. See section "LEGACY
                COMPATIBILITY" for more details.

            Some examples of using the "traits" parameter in "new":

                # provide support for *only* the REST API; throw exceptions on error
                $nt = Net::Twitter->new(traits => ['API::REST']);

                # provide support for both the REST and Search APIs; wrap errors
                $nt = Net::Twitter->new(traits => [qw/API::REST API::Search WrapError/]);

                # ensure full legacy support
                $nt = Net::Twitter->new(traits => ['Legacy']);

                # currently, these 2 calls to new are equivalent:
                $nt = Net::Twitter->new();
                $nt = Net::Twitter->new(traits => ['Legacy']);

        legacy
            A boolean. If set to 0, "new" constructs a "Net::Twitter" object
            implementing the REST API and throws exceptions on API method
            errors.

                Net::Twitter->new(legacy => 0);

            is a shortcut for:

                Net::Twitter->new(traits => ['API::REST']);

            If set to 1, "new" constructs a "Net::Twitter" object with the
            "Legacy" trait.

                Net::Twitter->new(legacy => 1);

            is a shortcut for:

                Net::Twitter->new(traits => ['Legacy']);

        username
            This is the screen name or email used to authenticate with
            Twitter.

        password
            This is the password used to authenticate with Twitter.

        clientname
            The value for the "X-Twitter-Client-Name" HTTP header. It
            defaults to "Perl Net::Twitter".

        clientver
            The value for the "X-Twitter-Client-Version" HTTP header. It
            defaults to current version of the "Net::Twitter" module.

        clienturl
            The value for the "X-Twitter-Client-URL" HTTP header. It
            defaults to the search.cpan.org page for the "Net::Twitter"
            distribution.

        useragent_class
            The "LWP::UserAgent" compatible class used internally by
            "Net::Twitter". It defaults to "LWP::UserAgent". For POE based
            applications, consider using "LWP::UserAgent::POE".

        useragent_args
            An HASH ref of arguments to pass to constructor of the class
            specified with "useragent_class", above. It defaults to {} (an
            empty HASH ref).

        useragent
            The value for "User-Agent" HTTP header. It defaults to
            "Net::Twitter/$VERSION (Perl)", where $VERSION is the current
            version of "Net::Twitter".

        source
            The value used in the "source" parameter of API method calls. It
            is currently only used in the "update" method in the REST API.
            It defaults to "twitterpm". This results in the text "from
            Net::Twitter" rather than "from web" for status messages posted
            from "Net::Twitter" when displayed via the Twitter web
            interface.

            Twitter is no longer registering source parameters. New
            applications should implement OAuth and register via
            <http://twitter.com/oauth_clients>.

            Only use the "source" parameter if you have an existing,
            registered source parameter from Twitter.

        apiurl
            The URL for the Twitter API. This defaults to
            "http://api.twitter.com/1". This option is available when the
            "API::REST" trait is included.

        apihost
            DEPRECATED - Setting the "apiurl" is sufficient.

        apirealm
            A string containing the Twitter API realm used for Basic
            Authentication. It defaults to "Twitter API". This option is
            available when the "API::REST" trait is included.

        identica
            If set to 1, "Net::Twitter" overrides the defaults for "apiurl",
            "apihost", and "apirealm" to "http://identi.ca/api",
            "identi.ca:80", and "Laconica API" respectively. It defaults to
            0. This option is available when the "API::REST" trait is
            included.

        consumer_key
            A string containing the OAuth consumer key provided by Twitter
            when an application is registered. This option is available when
            the "OAuth" trait is included.

        consumer_secret
            A string containing the OAuth consumer secret. This option is
            available when the "OAuth" trait is included.

        ssl If set to 1, an SSL connection will be used for all API calls.
            Defaults to 0.

        netrc
            (Optional) Sets the *machine* key to look up in ".netrc" to
            obtain credentials. If set to 1, Net::Twitter will use the value
            of the "netrc_machine" option (below).

               # in .netrc
               machine api.twitter.com
                 login YOUR_TWITTER_USER_NAME
                 password YOUR_TWITTER_PASSWORD
               machine semifor.twitter.com
                 login semifor
                 password SUPERSECRET

               # in your perl program
               $nt = Net::Twitter->new(netrc => 1);
               $nt = Net::Twitter->new(netrc => 'semifor.twitter.com');

        netrc_machine
            (Optional) Sets the "machine" entry to look up in ".netrc" when
            "<netrc =" 1>> is used. Defaults to "api.twitter.com".

        decode_html_entities
            Twitter encodes HTML entities in the "text" field of statuses.
            Set this option to 1 to have them automatically decoded. Default
            0.

    credentials($username, $password)
        Set the credentials for Basic Authentication. This is helpful for
        managing multiple accounts.

    ua  Provides access to the constructed user agent object used internally
        by "Net::Twitter". Use it with caution.

AUTHENTICATION
    Twitter currently provides two authentication strategies: Basic
    Authentication and OAuth. OAuth is officially in beta, however, Twitter
    has expressed a desire to deprecate Basic Authentication in the future,
    so consider using OAuth in your applications.

    To set up Basic Authentication in "Net::Twitter", provide the "username"
    and "password" options to "new" or call the "credentials" method.

    To set up OAuth, include the "OAuth" trait and include the
    "consumer_key" and "consumer_secret" options to "new". See
    Net::Twitter::Role::OAuth for more information on using OAuth, including
    examples.

    In addition to the arguments specified for each API method described
    below, an additional "authenticate" parameter can be passed. To request
    an "Authorization" header, pass "authenticated => 1"; to suppress an
    authentication header, pass "authentication => 0". Even if requested, an
    Authorization header will not be added if there are no user credentials
    (username and password for Basic Authentication; access tokens for
    OAuth).

    This is probably only useful for the "rate_limit_status" method in the
    REST API, since it returns different values for an authenticated and a
    non-authenticated call.

API METHODS AND ARGUMENTS
    Most Twitter API methods take parameters. All Net::Twitter API methods
    will accept a HASH ref of named parameters as specified in the Twitter
    API documentation. For convenience, many Net::Twitter methods accept
    simple positional arguments as documented, below. The positional
    parameter passing style is optional; you can always use the named
    parameters in a hash ref if you prefer.

    For example, the REST API method "update" has one required parameter,
    "status". You can call "update" with a HASH ref argument:

        $nt->update({ status => 'Hello world!' });

    Or, you can use the convenient form:

        $nt->update('Hello world!');

    The "update" method also has an optional parameter,
    "in_reply_to_status_id". To use it, you must use the HASH ref form:

        $nt->update({ status => 'Hello world!', in_reply_to_status_id => $reply_to });

    Convenience form is provided for the required parameters of all API
    methods. So, these two calls are equivalent:

        $nt->friendship_exists({ user_a => $fred, user_b => $barney });
        $nt->friendship_exists($fred, $barney);

    Many API methods have aliases. You can use the API method name, or any
    of its aliases, as you prefer. For example, these calls are all
    equivalent:

        $nt->friendship_exists($fred, $barney);
        $nt->relationship_exists($fred, $barney);
        $nt->follows($fred, $barney);

    Aliases support both the HASH ref and convenient forms:

        $nt->follows({ user_a => $fred, user_b => $barney });

  Cursors and Paging
    Some methods return partial results a page at a time. Originally,
    methods that returned partial results used a "page" parameter. A more
    recent addition to the Twitter API for retrieving multiple pages uses
    the "cursor" parameter. Usually, a method uses either the "page"
    parameter or the "cursor" parameter, but not both. There have been
    exceptions to this rule when Twitter deprecates the use of "page" for a
    method in favor of "cursor". In that case, both methods may work during
    a transition period. So, if a method supports both, you should always
    use the "cursor" parameter.

   Paging
    For methods that support paging, the first page is returned by passing
    "page => 1", the second page by passing "page => 2", etc. If no "page"
    parameter is passed, the first page is returned.

    Here's an example that demonstrates how to obtain all favorites in a
    loop:

        my @favs;
        for ( my $page = 1; ; ++$page ) {
            my $r = $nt->favorites({ page => $page });
            last unless @$r;

            push @favs, @$r;
        }

   Cursors
    Cursoring employs a different strategy. To obtain the first page of
    results, pass "cursor => -1". Twitter returns a reference to a hash that
    includes entries "next_cursor", "previous_cursor", and an entry with a
    reference to an array containing a page of the requested items. The key
    for the array reference will be named "users", "ids", or something
    similar depending upon the type of returned items. For example, when
    "cursor" parameter is used with the "followers_ids" method, the returned
    in hash entry "ids".

    The "next_cursor" value can be used in a subsequent call to obtain the
    next page of results. When you have obtained the last page of results,
    "next_cursor" will be 0. Likewise, you can use the value for
    "previous_cursor" to obtain the previous page of results. When you have
    obtained the first page, "previous_cursor" will be 0.

    Here's an example that demonstrates how to obtain all follower IDs in a
    loop using the "cursor" parameter:

        my @ids;
        for ( my $cursor = -1, my $r; $cursor; $cursor = $r->{next_cursor} ) {
            $r = $nt->followers_ids({ cursor => $cursor });
            push @ids, @{ $r->{ids} };
        }

  Synthetic Arguments
    In addition to the arguments described in the Twitter API Documentation
    for each API method, Net::Twitter supports additional *synthetic*
    arguments.

    authenticate
        When set to 1, Net::Twitter will provide an Authorization header for
        the API call; when set to 0, it will suppress the Authentication
        header. This argument overrides the defined authentication behavior
        for the API method. It is probably only useful for the
        "rate_limit_satus" method which returns different values for
        authenticated and unauthenticated calls. See "AUTHENTICATION" for
        more details.

    since
        API methods that accept the "since_id" argument will also accept the
        synthetic "since" argument, instead. "since" may be a "Date::Time"
        object, an epoch time (the number of seconds since the system
        epoch), or a string in the same format returned by Twitter for the
        "created_at" attribute. Only statuses with a "created_at" time
        greater than "since" will be returned by the API call.

REST API Methods
    These methods are provided when trait "API::REST" is included in the
    "traits" option to "new".

    Several of these methods accept a user ID as the "id" parameter. The
    user ID can be either a screen name, or the users numeric ID. To
    disambiguate, use the "screen_name" or "user_id" parameters, instead.

    For example, These calls are equivalent:

        $nt->create_friend('perl_api');    # screen name
        $nt->create_friend(1564061);       # numeric ID
        $nt->create_friend({ id => 'perl_api' });
        $nt->create_friend({ screen_name => 'perl_api' });
        $nt->create_friend({ user_id     => 1564061 });

    However user_id 911 and screen_name 911 are separate Twitter accounts.
    These calls are NOT equivalent:

        $nt->create_friend(911); # interpreted as screen name
        $nt->create_friend({ user_id => 911 }); # screen name: richellis

    Whenever the "id" parameter is required and "user_id" and "screen_name"
    are also parameters, using any one of them satisfies the requirement.

    block_exists
    block_exists(id)

        Parameters: id, user_id, screen_name
        Required: id

        Returns if the authenticating user is blocking a target user. Will

        as suspended users will be filtered out. Set the optional "cursor"
        parameter to -1 to get the first page of users. Set it to the prior
        return's value of "previous_cursor" or "next_cursor" to page forward
        or backwards. When there are no prior pages, the value of
        "previous_cursor" will be 0. When there are no subsequent pages, the
        value of "next_cursor" will be 0.

        as suspended users will be filtered out. Set the optional "cursor"
        parameter to -1 to get the first page of users. Set it to the prior
        return's value of "previous_cursor" or "next_cursor" to page forward
        or backwards. When there are no prior pages, the value of
        "previous_cursor" will be 0. When there are no subsequent pages, the

    new_direct_message
    new_direct_message(user, text)

        Parameters: user, text, screen_name, user_id
        Required: user, text

        Sends a new direct message to the specified user from the
        authenticating user. Requires both the user and text parameters.
        Returns the sent message when successful. In order to support
        numeric screen names, the "screen_name" or "user_id" parameters may
        be used instead of "user".

        Returns: DirectMessage

    public_timeline

        Parameters: *none*
        Required: *none*

        Returns the 20 most recent statuses from non-protected users who
        have set a custom user icon. Does not require authentication. Note
        that the public timeline is cached for 60 seconds so requesting it
        more often than that is a waste of resources.

        If user credentials are provided, "public_timeline" calls are
        authenticated, so they count against the authenticated user's rate
        limit. Use "->public_timeline({ authenticate => 0 })" to make an
        unauthenticated call which will count against the calling IP
        address' rate limit, instead.

        Returns: ArrayRef[Status]

    rate_limit_status

        Parameters: *none*
        Required: *none*

        Returns the remaining number of API requests available to the
        authenticated user before the API limit is reached for the current
        hour.

        Use "->rate_limit_status({ authenticate => 0 })" to force an
        unauthenticated call, which will return the status for the IP
        address rather than the authenticated user. (Note: for a web
        application, this is the server's IP address.)

        Returns: RateLimitStatus

    report_spam
    report_spam(id)

        Parameters: id, user_id, screen_name

    trends_available

        Parameters: lat, long
        Required: *none*

        Returns the locations with trending topic information. The response

        Yahoo! Where On Earth ID
        <http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/>) and some other
        human-readable information such as a the location's canonical name
        and country.

        When the optional "lat" and "long" parameters are passed, the
        available trend locations are sorted by distance from that location,
        nearest to farthest.

        Use the WOEID returned in the location object to query trends for a
        specific location.

        Returns: ArrayRef[Location]

    trends_location(woeid)

        Parameters: woeid
        Required: woeid

        Returns the top 10 trending topics for a specific location. The
        response is an array of "trend" objects that encode the name of the
        trending topic, the query parameter that can be used to search for
        the topic on Search, and the direct URL that can be issued against
        Search. This information is cached for five minutes, and therefore
        users are discouraged from querying these endpoints faster than once
        every five minutes. Global trends information is also available from
        this API by using a WOEID of 1.

        Returns: ArrayRef[Trend]

    update
    update(status)

        Parameters: status, lat, long, in_reply_to_status_id

        authenticating user's current status will be ignored.

        The optional "lat" and "long" parameters add location data to the
        status for a geo enabled account. They expect values in the ranges
        -90.0 to +90.0 and -180.0 to +180.0 respectively. They are ignored
        unless the user's "geo_enabled" field is true.

    update_profile_image
    update_profile_image(image)

        Parameters: image
        Required: image

          [ $file, $filename, Content_Type => $mime_type ]
          [ undef, $filename, Content_Type => $mime_type, Content => $raw_image_data ]

        The first value of the array ($file) is the name of a file to open.
        The second value ($filename) is the name given to Twitter for the
        file. If $filename is not provided, the basename portion of $file is
        used. If $mime_type is not provided, it will be provided
        automatically using LWP::MediaTypes::guess_media_type().

        $raw_image_data can be provided, rather than opening a file, by
        passing "undef" as the first array value.

        Returns: ExtendedUser

Lists API
    For Lists API support, add trait "API::Lists" to the "traits" option in
    "new".

    For full documentation of the Lists API, see
    Net::Twitter::Role::API::Lists.

      use Net::Twitter;

      my $nt = Net::Twitter->new(traits => ['API::Lists'], ...);

      $list = $nt->create_list($owner, { name => $name, description => $desc });
      $list = $nt->update_list($owner, $list_id, { description => $desc });

      $lists = $nt->get_lists($owner);
      $lists = $nt->list_lists($owner);

      $list = $nt->get_list($owner, $list_id);
      $list = $nt->delete_list($owner, $list_id);

      $statuses = $nt->list_statuses($owner, $list_id);

      $lists = $nt->list_memberships($owner);
      $lists = $nt->list_subscriptions($owner);

      $users = $nt->list_members($owner, $list_id);

      $user_or_undef = $nt->list_members($owner, $list_id, { id => $user_id });

      $user = $nt->add_list_member($owner, $list_id, $user_id);

      $user = $nt->delete_list_member($owner, $list_id, $user_id);
      $user = $nt->remove_list_member($owner, $list_id, $user_id);

      $user_or_undef = $nt->is_list_member($owner, $list_id, $user_id);

      $users = $nt->list_subscribers($owner, $list_id);

      $list = $nt->subscribe_list($owner, $list_id);
      $list = $nt->unsubscribe_list($owner, $list_id);

      $user_or_undef = $nt->is_subscribed_list($owner, $list_id, $user_id);
      $user_or_undef = $nt->is_list_subscriber($owner, $list_id, $user_id);

LEGACY COMPATIBILITY
    This version of "Net::Twitter" automatically includes the "Legacy" trait
    if no "traits" option is provided to "new". Therefore, these 2 calls are
    currently equivalent:

        $nt = Net::Twitter->new(username => $user, password => $passwd);
        $nt = Net::Twitter->new(
            username => $user,
            password => $passwd,
            traits   => ['Legacy'],
        );

    Thus, existing applications written for a prior version of
    "Net::Twitter" should continue to run, without modification, with this
    version.

    In a future release, the default traits may change. Prior to that
    change, however, a nearer future version will add a warning if no
    "traits" option is provided to "new". To avoid this warning, add an
    appropriate "traits" option to your existing application code.

ERROR HANDLING
    There are currently two strategies for handling errors: throwing
    exceptions and wrapping errors. Exception handling is the newer,
    recommended strategy.

  Wrapping Errors
    When trait "WrapError" is specified (or "Legacy", which includes trait
    "WrapError"), "Net::Twitter" returns undef on error. To retrieve
    information about the error, use methods "http_code", "http_message",
    and "get_error". These methods are described in the
    Net::Twitter::Role::WrapError.

        if ( my $followers = $nt->followers ) {
            for my $follower ( @$followers ) {
                #...
            }
        }
        else {
            warn "HTTP message: ", $nt->http_message, "\n";
        }

    Since an error is stored in the object instance, this error handling
    strategy is problematic when using a user agent like
    "LWP::UserAgent::POE" that provides concurrent requests. The error for
    one request can be overwritten by a concurrent request before you have
    an opportunity to access it.

  Exception Handling
    When "Net::Twitter" encounters a Twitter API error or a network error,
    it throws a "Net::Twitter::Error" object. You can catch and process
    these exceptions by using "eval" blocks and testing $@:

        eval {
            my $statuses = $nt->friends_timeline(); # this might die!

            for my $status ( @$statuses ) {
                #...
            }
        };
        if ( $@ ) {
            # friends_timeline encountered an error

            if ( blessed $@ && $@->isa('Net::Twitter::Error') ) {
                #... use the thrown error obj
                warn $@->error;
            }
            else {
                # something bad happened!
                die $@;
            }
        }

    "Net::Twitter::Error" stringifies to something reasonable, so if you
    don't need detailed error information, you can simply treat $@ as a
    string:

        eval { $nt->update($status) };
        if ( $@ ) {
            warn "update failed because: $@\n";
        }

FAQ
    Why does "->followers({ screen_name => $friend })" return *my* followers
    instead of $friends's?
        First, check carefully to make sure you've spelled "screen_name"
        correctly. Twitter sometimes discards parameters it doesn't
        recognize. In this case, the result is a list of your own
        followers---the same thing that would happen if you called
        "followers" without the "screen_name" parameter.

    How do I use the "geocode" parameter in the Search API?
        The "geocode" parameter value includes a latitude, longitude, and
        radius separated with commas.

            $r = $nt->search({ geocode => "45.511795,-122.675629,25mi" });
