=head1 NAME

Net::Twitter::Manual::MigratingToV1_1 - Migrating from Twitter API v1 to v1.1

=head1 VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Twitter

    my $nt = Net::Twitter->new(
        traits              => [qw/API::RESTv1_1/],
        consumer_key        => $consumer_key,
        consumer_secret     => $consumer_secret,
        access_token        => $access_token,
        access_token_secret => $access_token_secret,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Twitter prior to version 4.0 used Twitter API version 1. Twitter API v1.1
introduced changes that are not entirely backwards compatible, requiring some
changes to calling code.

Net::Twitter attempts to provided backwards compatibility where possible. This
document describes the changes required to your existing application code,
using Net::Twitter, for use with Twitter's API v1.1.

=head1 FIRST

=head2 Include the API::RESTv1_1 trait

Wherever you create a Net::Twitter object by calling C<new>, replace trait
C<API::REST> with C<API::RESTv1_1>. For most applications, that's all that is
required.

=head1 EXCEPTIONS

=item Trait RateLimit incompatible with API::RESTv1_1

The C<RateLimit> trait is incompatible with Twitter API v1.1. Rate limiting is
one of the most extensive changes in v1.1. In v1 there were two hourly rate
limits, one per IP address for unauthenticated calls, and one
per-user/application for authenticated calls. In v1.1, all calls must be
authenticated, and each API endpoint (i.e., each method) has it's own rate
limit. Rather than hourly, the new rate limits operate on a 15 minute window.

If your code currently uses the C<RateLimit> role, you'll need to write some
custom code provide equivalent functionality.

=item search

The C<search> method semantics and return value are substantially different
between Twitter API v1 and v1.1. In v1, C<search> was provided by the
C<API::Search> trait. In v1.1, C<search> is included in the C<API::RESTv1_1>
trait.

So, first, drop C<API::Search> from your calls to C<new>. The C<API::Search>
trait is incompatible with C<API::RESTv1_1>.

In v1, Twitter returned a hashref with several keys containing meta data. The
actual array of results were contained in the C<results> slot:

    # With Twitter API v1
    my $nt = Net::Twitter->new(traits => [qw/API::REST API::Search/]);

    my $r = $nt->search('perl hacker');
    for my $status ( @{$r->{results} ) {
        # process each status...
    }

In v1.1, Twitter returns a hash with 2 slots: C<search_metadata> and C<statuses>.

    # With Twitter API v1.1
    my $nt = Net::Twitter->new(traits => [qw/API::RESTv1_1/], %oauth_credentials);

    my $r = $nt->searh('perl hacker');
    for my $status ( @{$r->{statuses} ) {
        # process each status...
    }

Paging through search results works differently in v1.1. In v1, Twitter
offered a C<page> parameter:

    # With Twitter API v1
    for ( my $page = 1; $page <= 10; ++$page ) {
        my $r = $nt->search({ q => $query, page => $page, rpp => 100 });
        last unless @{$r->{results}};

        # process a page of results...
    }

In v1.1, use C<max_id> and C<count> to get paged results:

    # With Twitter API v1.1
    for ( my %args = ( q => $query, count => 100 ), my $n = 0; $n < 1000; ) {
        my $r = $nt->search({ %$args });
        last unless @{$r->{statuses}};

        $args{max_id} = $r->{statuses}[-1]{id} - 1;
        $n += @{$r->{statuses}};

        # process a page of results...
    }
