twitter_api_method public_timeline => (

Returns the 20 most recent statuses from non-protected users who have
set a custom user icon.  Does not require authentication.  Note that
the public timeline is cached for 60 seconds so requesting it more
often than that is a waste of resources.

If user credentials are provided, C<public_timeline> calls are authenticated,
so they count against the authenticated user's rate limit.  Use C<<
->public_timeline({ authenticate => 0 }) >> to make an unauthenticated call
which will count against the calling IP address' rate limit, instead.

=item status

Required.  The text of your status update. URL encode as necessary. Statuses
over 140 characters will cause a 403 error to be returned from the API.

=item in_reply_to_status_id

Optional. The ID of an existing status that the update is in reply to.  o Note:
This parameter will be ignored unless the author of the tweet this parameter
references is mentioned within the status text. Therefore, you must include
@username, where username is the author of the referenced tweet, within the
update.

=item lat

Optional. The location's latitude that this tweet refers to.  The valid ranges
for latitude is -90.0 to +90.0 (North is positive) inclusive.  This parameter
will be ignored if outside that range, if it is not a number, if geo_enabled is
disabled, or if there not a corresponding long parameter with this tweet.

=item long

Optional. The location's longitude that this tweet refers to.  The valid ranges
for longitude is -180.0 to +180.0 (East is positive) inclusive.  This parameter
will be ignored if outside that range, if it is not a number, if geo_enabled is
disabled, or if there not a corresponding lat parameter with this tweet.

=item place_id

Optional. The place to attach to this status update.  Valid place_ids can be
found by querying C<reverse_geocode>.

=item display_coordinates

Optional. By default, geo-tweets will have their coordinates exposed in the
status object (to remain backwards compatible with existing API applications).
To turn off the display of the precise latitude and longitude (but keep the
contextual location information), pass C<display_coordinates => 0> on the
status update.

Search for places (cities and neighborhoods) that can be attached to a
statuses/update.  Given a latitude and a longitude, return a list of all the
valid places that can be used as a place_id when updating a status.
Conceptually, a query can be made from the user's location, retrieve a list of
places, have the user validate the location he or she is at, and then send the
ID of this location up with a call to statuses/update.

There are multiple granularities of places that can be returned --
"neighborhoods", "cities", etc.  At this time, only United States data is
available through this method.

=over 4

=item lat

Required.  The latitude to query about.  Valid ranges are -90.0 to +90.0 (North
is positive) inclusive.

=item long

Required. The longitude to query about.  Valid ranges are -180.0 to +180.0
(East is positive) inclusive.

=item accuracy

Optional. A hint on the "region" in which to search.  If a number, then this is
a radius in meters, but it can also take a string that is suffixed with ft to
specify feet.  If this is not passed in, then it is assumed to be 0m.  If
coming from a device, in practice, this value is whatever accuracy the device
has measuring its location (whether it be coming from a GPS, WiFi
triangulation, etc.).

=item granularity

Optional.  The minimal granularity of data to return.  If this is not passed
in, then C<neighborhood> is assumed.  C<city> can also be passed.

=item max_results

Optional.  A hint as to the number of results to return.  This does not
guarantee that the number of results returned will equal max_results, but
instead informs how many "nearby" results to return.  Ideally, only pass in the
number of places you intend to display to the user here.
